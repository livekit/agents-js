# LiveKit Agents for Node.js

The Agents Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable
participants that run on servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal
voice agents that can see, hear, and understand.

This package contains the main LiveKit Agents SDK. Refer to the
[documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/overview/) for information on how
to use it, or browse the [API
reference](https://docs.livekit.io/agents-js/modules/agents.html). See the
[repository](https://github.com/livekit/agents-js) for more information about
the framework as a whole.
