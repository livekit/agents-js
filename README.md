# LiveKit Agents for Node.js

<!--BEGIN_DESCRIPTION-->

The Agent Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable participants that run on
servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal voice agents that can see, hear, and
understand.

This is a Node.js distribution of the [LiveKit Agents framework](https://livekit.io/agents),
originally written in Python.

<!--END_DESCRIPTION-->

## ✨ [NEW] OpenAI Realtime API support

We're partnering with OpenAI on a new MultimodalAgent API in the Agents framework. This class
completely wraps OpenAI’s Realtime API, abstract away the raw wire protocol, and provide an
ultra-low latency WebRTC transport between GPT-4o and your users’ devices. This same stack powers
Advanced Voice in the ChatGPT app.

- Try the Realtime API in our [playground](https://playground.livekit.io/)
  [[code](https://github.com/livekit-examples/realtime-playground)]
- Check out our [guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/openai) to building your first app with this new API

> [!WARNING]
> This SDK is in Developer Preview. During this period, you may encounter bugs, and the APIs may
> change. Currently, only the OpenAI Realtime voice assistant is available as a plugin.
>
> For production, we recommend using the [more mature version](https://github.com/livekit/agents)
> of this framework, built with Python, which also supports other integrations.
>
> We welcome and appreciate any feedback or contributions. You can create issues here or chat live
> with us in the [LiveKit Community Slack](https://livekit.io/join-slack).

## Installation

To install the core Agents library:

```bash
pnpm install @livekit/agents
```

To install the OpenAI plugin, for optional support for realtime voice assistants:

```bash
pnpm install @livekit/agents-plugin-openai
```

## Usage

First, a few concepts:

- **Agent**: A function that defines the workflow of a programmable, server-side participant. This
  is your application code.
- **Worker**: A container process responsible for managing job queuing with LiveKit server. Each
  worker is capable of running multiple agents simultaneously.
- **Plugin**: A library class that performs a specific task, *e.g.* speech-to-text, from a specific
  provider. An agent can compose multiple plugins together to perform more complex tasks.

Your main file for an agent is built of two parts:

- The boilerplate code that runs when you run this file, creating a new worker to orchestrate jobs
- The code that is exported when this file is imported into Agents, to be ran on all jobs (which
  includes your entrypoint function, and an optional prewarm function)

Refer to the [minimal voice assistant](/examples/src/minimal_assistant.ts) example to understand
how to build a simple voice assistant with function calling using OpenAI's model.

## Running

The framework exposes a CLI interface to run your agent. To get started, you'll need the following
environment variables set:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

The following command will start the worker and wait for users to connect to your LiveKit server:

```bash
node my_agent.js start
```

To run the worker in dev mode (outputting colourful pretty-printed debug logs), run it using `dev`:

```bash
node my_agent.js dev
```

### Using playground for your agent UI

To ease the process of building and testing an agent, we've developed a versatile web frontend
called "playground". You can use or modify this app to suit your specific requirements. It can also
serve as a starting point for a completely custom agent application.

- [Source code](https://github.com/livekit/agents-playground)
- [Playground docs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/playground)

### Joining a specific room

To join a LiveKit room that's already active, you can use the `connect` command:

```bash
node my_agent.ts connect --room <my-room>
```

### FAQ

#### What happens when I run my agent?

When you follow the steps above to run your agent, a worker is started that opens an authenticated
WebSocket connection to a LiveKit server instance(defined by your `LIVEKIT_URL` and authenticated
with an access token).

No agents are actually running at this point. Instead, the worker is waiting for LiveKit server to
give it a job.

When a room is created, the server notifies one of the registered workers about a new job.
The notified worker can decide whether or not to accept it. If the worker accepts the job, the
worker will instantiate your agent as a participant and have it join the room where it can start
subscribing to tracks. A worker can manage multiple agent instances simultaneously.

If a notified worker rejects the job or does not accept within a predetermined timeout period, the
server will route the job request to another available worker.

#### What happens when I SIGTERM a worker?

The orchestration system was designed for production use cases. Unlike the typical web server, an
agent is a stateful program, so it's important that a worker isn't terminated while active sessions
are ongoing.

When calling SIGTERM on a worker, the worker will signal to LiveKit server that it no longer wants
additional jobs. It will also auto-reject any new job requests that get through before the server
signal is received. The worker will remain alive while it manages any agents connected to rooms.
