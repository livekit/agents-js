# LiveKit Agents for Node.js

<!--BEGIN_DESCRIPTION-->

The Agent Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable participants that run on
servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal voice agents that can see, hear, and
understand.

This is a Node.js distribution of the [LiveKit Agents framework](https://livekit.io/agents),
originally written in Python.

Looking for the Python library? Check out [Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents).

<!--END_DESCRIPTION-->

## ✨ 1.0 Release ✨

This README reflects the 1.0 release. See the [migration guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/v0-migration/nodejs/) if you're trying to upgrade from `0.x`.

## Features

- **Flexible integrations**: A comprehensive ecosystem to mix and match the right STT, LLM, TTS, and Realtime API to suit your use case.
- **Extensive WebRTC clients**: Build client applications using LiveKit's open-source SDK ecosystem, supporting all major platforms.
- **Exchange data with clients**: Use [RPCs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/rpc/) and other [Data APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/) to seamlessly exchange data with clients.
- **Semantic turn detection**: Uses a transformer model to detect when a user is done with their turn, helps to reduce interruptions.
- **Open-source**: Fully open-source, allowing you to run the entire stack on your own servers, including [LiveKit server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit), one of the most widely used WebRTC media servers.

## Installation

The framework includes a variety of plugins that make it easy to process streaming input or generate
output. For example, there are plugins for converting text-to-speech or running inference with
popular LLMs.

- Install `pnpm` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

To install the core Agents library as well as plugins, run:

```bash
pnpm install @livekit/agents
```

Currently, only the following plugins are supported:

## Docs and guides

Documentation on the framework and how to use it can be found [here](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/)

## Recommended starter app

Kickstart a complete voice AI pipeline (LLM, STT, TTS) with the LiveKit Agents Starter for Node.js:

- [livekit-examples/agent-starter-node](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-node)

It includes a ready-made assistant, multilingual turn detection, background noise cancellation, metrics/logging, and a production-ready Dockerfile. Start fast, then tailor it with your preferred models and plugins.

## Core concepts

- Agent: An LLM-based application with defined instructions.
- AgentSession: A container for agents that manages interactions with end users.
- entrypoint: The starting point for an interactive session, similar to a request handler in a web server.
- Worker: The main process that coordinates job scheduling and launches agents for user sessions.

## Usage

Checkout the [quickstart guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/)

### Simple voice agent

---

```ts
import {
  type JobContext,
  type JobProcess,
  WorkerOptions,
  cli,
  defineAgent,
  llm,
  voice,
  inference,
} from '@livekit/agents';
import * as silero from '@livekit/agents-plugin-silero';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
import { z } from 'zod';

const lookupWeather = llm.tool({
  description: 'Used to look up weather information.',
  parameters: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The location to look up weather information for'),
  }),
  execute: async ({ location }, { ctx }) => {
    return { weather: 'sunny', temperature: 70 };
  },
});

export default defineAgent({
  prewarm: async (proc: JobProcess) => {
    proc.userData.vad = await silero.VAD.load();
  },
  entry: async (ctx: JobContext) => {
    const agent = new voice.Agent({
      instructions: 'You are a friendly voice assistant built by LiveKit.',
      tools: { lookupWeather },
    });

    const session = new voice.AgentSession({
      // Speech-to-text (STT) is your agent's ears, turning the user's speech into text that the LLM can understand
      // See all available models at https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/stt/
      // stt: new inference.STT({ model: 'assemblyai/universal-streaming:en', language: 'en' }),
      stt: 'assemblyai/universal-streaming:en',
      // A Large Language Model (LLM) is your agent's brain, processing user input and generating a response
      // See all available models at https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/llm/
      // llm: new inference.LLM({ model: 'openai/gpt-4.1-mini' }),
      llm: 'openai/gpt-4.1-mini',
      // Text-to-speech (TTS) is your agent's voice, turning the LLM's text into speech that the user can hear
      // See all available models as well as voice selections at https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/tts/
      // tts: new inference.TTS({ model: 'cartesia/sonic-2:9626c31c-bec5-4cca-baa8-f8ba9e84c8bc', voice: '9626c31c-bec5-4cca-baa8-f8ba9e84c8bc' }),
      tts: 'cartesia/sonic-2:9626c31c-bec5-4cca-baa8-f8ba9e84c8bc',
      // VAD and turn detection are used to determine when the user is speaking and when the agent should respond
      // See more at https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns
      vad: ctx.proc.userData.vad! as silero.VAD,
      turnDetection: new livekit.turnDetector.MultilingualModel(),
      // to use realtime model, replace the stt, llm, tts and vad with the following
      // llm: new openai.realtime.RealtimeModel(),
    });

    await session.start({
      agent,
      room: ctx.room,
    });

    await session.generateReply({
      instructions: 'greet the user and ask about their day',
    });
  },
});

cli.runApp(new WorkerOptions({ agent: fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) }));
```

No third-party API keys are required for this example. It runs out of the box via the [LiveKit Inference Gateway](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/#inference).

### Multi-agent handoff

---

This code snippet is abbreviated. For the full example, see [multi_agent.ts](examples/src/multi_agent.ts)

```ts
type StoryData = {
  name?: string;
  location?: string;
};

class IntroAgent extends voice.Agent<StoryData> {
  constructor() {
    super({
      instructions: `You are a story teller. Your goal is to gather a few pieces of information from the user to make the story personalized and engaging. Ask the user for their name and where they are from.`,
      tools: {
        informationGathered: llm.tool({
          description:
            'Called when the user has provided the information needed to make the story personalized and engaging.',
          parameters: z.object({
            name: z.string().describe('The name of the user'),
            location: z.string().describe('The location of the user'),
          }),
          execute: async ({ name, location }, { ctx }) => {
            ctx.userData.name = name;
            ctx.userData.location = location;

            return llm.handoff({
              agent: new StoryAgent(name, location),
              returns: "Let's start the story!",
            });
          },
        }),
      },
    });
  }

  // Use inheritance to create agent with custom hooks
  async onEnter() {
    this.session.generateReply({
      instructions: '"greet the user and gather information"',
    });
  }
}

class StoryAgent extends voice.Agent<StoryData> {
  constructor(name: string, location: string) {
    super({
      instructions: `You are a storyteller. Use the user's information in order to make the story personalized.
        The user's name is ${name}, from ${location}`,
    });
  }

  async onEnter() {
    this.session.generateReply();
  }
}

export default defineAgent({
  prewarm: async (proc: JobProcess) => {
    proc.userData.vad = await silero.VAD.load();
  },
  entry: async (ctx: JobContext) => {
    await ctx.connect();
    const participant = await ctx.waitForParticipant();
    console.log('participant joined: ', participant.identity);

    const userdata: StoryData = {};

    const session = new voice.AgentSession({
      vad: ctx.proc.userData.vad! as silero.VAD,
      stt: new deepgram.STT(),
      llm: new openai.LLM(),
      tts: new elevenlabs.TTS(),
      userData: userdata,
    });

    await session.start({
      agent: new IntroAgent(),
      room: ctx.room,
    });
  },
});
```

### Running your agent

The framework exposes a CLI interface to run your agent. To get started, you'll need the following
environment variables set:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- any additional provider API keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

The following command will start the worker and wait for users to connect to your LiveKit server:

```bash
pnpm run build && node ./examples/src/restaurant_agent.ts dev
```

### Using playground for your agent UI

To ease the process of building and testing an agent, we've developed a versatile web frontend
called "playground". You can use or modify this app to suit your specific requirements. It can also
serve as a starting point for a completely custom agent application.

- [Hosted playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io)
- [Source code](https://github.com/livekit/agents-playground)
- [Playground docs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/playground)

### Running for production

```shell
pnpm run build && node ./examples/src/restaurant_agent.ts start
```

Runs the agent with production-ready optimizations.

### FAQ

#### What happens when I run my agent?

When you follow the steps above to run your agent, a worker is started that opens an authenticated
WebSocket connection to a LiveKit server instance(defined by your `LIVEKIT_URL` and authenticated
with an access token).

No agents are actually running at this point. Instead, the worker is waiting for LiveKit server to
give it a job.

When a room is created, the server notifies one of the registered workers about a new job.
The notified worker can decide whether or not to accept it. If the worker accepts the job, the
worker will instantiate your agent as a participant and have it join the room where it can start
subscribing to tracks. A worker can manage multiple agent instances simultaneously.

If a notified worker rejects the job or does not accept within a predetermined timeout period, the
server will route the job request to another available worker.

#### What happens when I SIGTERM a worker?

The orchestration system was designed for production use cases. Unlike the typical web server, an
agent is a stateful program, so it's important that a worker isn't terminated while active sessions
are ongoing.

When calling SIGTERM on a worker, the worker will signal to LiveKit server that it no longer wants
additional jobs. It will also auto-reject any new job requests that get through before the server
signal is received. The worker will remain alive while it manages any agents connected to rooms.
