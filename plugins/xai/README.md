# xAI plugin for LiveKit Agents

The Agents Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable
participants that run on servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal
voice agents that can see, hear, and understand.

This package contains the xAI plugin, which provides access to xAI's Grok models
via the Realtime API. Refer to the
[documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/overview/) for information on how
to use it.

See the [repository](https://github.com/livekit/agents-js) for more information
about the framework as a whole.
