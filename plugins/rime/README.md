# Rime plugin for LiveKit Agents

The Agents Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable
participants that run on servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal
voice agents that can see, hear, and understand.

This package contains the Rime plugin, which allows for voice synthesis.
Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/overview/).
See the [repository](https://github.com/livekit/agents-js) for more information
about the framework as a whole.
