# Contributing to agents-js

The LiveKit Node Agents framework is an open-source project, and we welcome any contribution from
anyone willing to work in good faith with the community. No contribution is too small!

## Code of Conduct

The Node Agents project has a [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to which all contributors must
adhere.

## Contribute code

There are many ways you can contribute code to the project:

- **Write a plugin**: if there is a TTS/STT/LLM provider you use that isn't on our plugins list,
  feel free to write a plugin for it! Refer to the source code of similar plugins to see how they're
  built.

- **Fix bugs**: we strive to make this framework as reliable as possible, and we'd appreciate your
  help with squashing bugs and improving stability. Follow the guidelines below for information
  about authoring pull requests.

- **Add new features**: we're open to adding new features to the framework, though we ask that you
  open an issue first to discuss the viability and scope of the new functionality before starting
  work.

Our continuous integration requires a few additional code quality steps for your pull request to
be approved:

- Base your work off of the `next` branch instead of `main`. `next` is the most up-to-date branch.

- When creating a new file, make sure to add SPDX headers for [REUSE-3.2](https://reuse.software)
  compliance. If you don't know what that means, just copy the three first lines from any other
  TypeScript file in the repository and paste them at the top of your file.

- Run `pnpm -w format:write` and `pnpm -w lint:fix` before committing your changes to ensure
  consistent file formatting and best practices.

- If writing new methods/interfaces/enums/classes, document them. This project uses
  [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org) for automatic API documentation generation, and every new addition
  has to be properly documented.

- On your first pull request, the CLA Assistant bot will give you a link to sign this project's
  Contributor License Agreement, required to add your code to the repository.

- There's no need to mess around with `CHANGELOG.md` or package manifests â€” we have a bot handle
  that for us. A maintainer will add the necessary notes before merging.

## Assist others in the community

If you can't contribute code, you can still help us greatly by helping out community members who
may have questions about the framework and how to use it. Join the `#agents` channel on
[our Slack](https://livekit.io/join-slack).
